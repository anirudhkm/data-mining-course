This README is for the program recommender_system.py

a) This program is takes the training files from u1.base, u2.base,... u5.base and test files as u1.test, u2.test, ... u5.test.

b) Then based on the input we get dictionaries based on users and movies.

c) THen we get the attributes of the users such as gender, profession and age. 

d) Based on this, we find the similarity between users. 

e) Based on this similarity, we predict the rating for the movie 'j' which is not seen by user 'i'. 

f) Finally, we predict the mean absolute difference to measure performance. 

g) The output of the file can be seen in the file user_attr_recommend_sys.txt.
