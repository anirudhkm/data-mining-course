This README corresponds to the program "curse_of_dimensionality.py" 

1. This program takes the 'n', the data points to be generated as a system argument.

2. Then, with dimensions from 1, 2, 3, 4, .... 100, we generate data points with random data values between 0 and 1 for 5 trails and take the mean of them.

3. Then, we calculate the r(k) value based on the given formula for this. 

4. Finally, we plot graph between no of dimensionality and r(k) value.

5. These steps are done for n = {100, 1000, 10000}.
