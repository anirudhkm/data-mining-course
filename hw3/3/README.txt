This README file corresponds to the association.py python program.

1. Run the association.py program with input data file, support, confidence and lift as system arguments.
2. Then, the program calls the functions in other files to compute results.
3. Both the F-k-1 * F-k-1 and F-k-1 and F-1 method are implemented in the program.
4. The counts of candidate itemset and frequent itemset and generated.
5. Then the count of closed frequent itemset and maximal frequent itemset are generated.
6. Next, the rules are generated using brute force and pruning based on confidence and the rules are written to files.
7. Finally, the rules are generated using brute force and pruning based on lift and the rules are written to files.
