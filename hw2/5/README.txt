This README file is associated with question 5.

1. The program is initiated by running the main.py file like "python main.py input_data impurity_measure".

2. This is start the execution of the program.

3. First, for each training data by the 10 fold CV, the trees are pruned by adding pessimistic error.

4. Then, the cost of each tree is found and the best among all the trees is displayed.

5. Then, the ROC, precision-recall curve are plotted for the data and other parameters such as accuracy, balance accuracy, F1 measure are calculated and displayed.
